# Workday-Planner
Allows you to schedule your workday by hour

html:
-Used Bootstrap to create the layout of the webpage
-added moment.min.js to create live clock at the top of the page and store the hour in military time to the constant = hour
-const = hour was used along with css classes to change the color of the boxes as time progressed
-wrote a long if statement to add and remove the color classes
-used a jQuery click event that will save text from the text area field to local storage by traversing the DOM using .parents and .find
-used jQuery to extract the info from the local storage and have it saved to the appropriate text field
-also added google fonts for some personal styling


css:
-very basic color schemes to add some flair to the webpage
-created the color classes that would be added to the page using the if statement
-added a nice background that seemed appropriate for the application
